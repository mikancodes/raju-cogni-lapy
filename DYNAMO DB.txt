DYNAMO DB---
--ITS A NON SQL OR NON RELATIONAL DATABASE
--FAST AND FLEXIBLE
--IN DYNAMO DB WE CREATE TABLE 
--ITS A NO SQL KEY VALUE TYPE OF DATABASE
--OFFERS HORIZONTAL SCALING I.E WE CAN CHANGE THE PERFORMANCE CHARECTERISTIC OF DYNAMO WITHOUT DOWNTIME
--Its flexible data model and reliable performance make DynamoDB a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, 
  advertising technology, Internet of Things, and other applications.

CAP THEOREM
--CONSISTENCY, AVAILABILITY, PARTITION TOLERANCE
C-ALL CLIENTS CAN SEE THE SAME VIEW OF DATA.IF YOU UPDATE DATA IN DYMANO DB IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR ALL 
  THE REPLICAS ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTITIONS TO BE UPDATED.
A-ALL CLIENTS CAN SEE THE REPLICA OF DATA EVEN IN CASE OF PARTIAL FAILURE
P-the system continue to work as expected even in partial failure BECAUSE OF ITS DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE.
   WHICH REPLICATES DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE NODES AND PARTITION. 

according to cap theorem inn case of no sql db it has to take 2 as mandatory and 1 as optional
--if all 3 os satishfied then it is called a ideal system which is not possible

DYNAMO DB LAP-
IT HAS TAKEN A AND P AS MANDATORY AND C AS OPTIONAL

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CONSISTENCY
--STRONG C-IF DATA IS UPDATED THEN IT WILL UPDATED IN REPLICAS IMMEDIATELY AND USER GETS UPDATED INFORMATION
--EVENTUALLY C-DATA IS UPDATED ONLY AFTER SOME TIME USER MAY OR MAY NOT GET UPDATED DATA

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DYNAMO DB IS FULLY MANAGED KEY VALUE AND COLUMNENT DB THAT DELIVERS SINGLE DIGIT PERFORMANCE AT ANY SCALE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THERE ARE 4 TYPES OF NO SQL DB
--KEY-VALUE BASED
--DOCUMENT BASED
--GRAPH BASED
--COLUMN FAMILY BASED

KEYS IN DYMANO DB-IT HALPS IN ACCESSING AND ORGANIUZING THE DATA
TWO TYPES OF KEYS ARE THERE
--PARTITION KEY-EXACTLY WORK LIKE YOUR PRIMARY KEY . IT UNIQUELY IDENTIFY EACH ITEM IN TABLE AND DETERMINES 
  THE PHYSICAL STORAGE LOCATION OF THE DATA

--SORT KEY-ITS A OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE THAT IS USED TO SORT THE ITEM WITH THE SAME PARTITION KEY
  SORT+PARTITION KEY=PRIMARY KEY
