REDSHIFT:
--ITS A CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSING TOOL AVAILABLE IN AWS.
--IT MANAGES ALL THE WORK OF SETTING UP, OPERATING AND SCALING A DATA WAREHOUSE
--ITS ASSIGN TO HANDLE LARGE SCALE DATA ANALYTICS WORKLOADS, MAMKING IT EASY TO ANALYSE DATA USING STANDARD SQL QUERIES
--IT USES COLUMNER STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND MPP TO DELIVER FAST QUERY PERFORMANCE ON LARGE DATA
--ITS A PAAS SERVICE(ONLY AVAILABLE IN AWS)
--ITS BASED ON A PARALLEL COMPUTING MODEL(MPP)

COMPONENTS OF REDSHIFT ARCHITECHTURE
//CLUSTER
--THE CORE INFRUSTRUCTURE COMPONENT OF AN REDSHIFT IS CULSTER
--REDSHIFT CLUSTER IS  COMBINATION OF LEADER NODE AND COMPUTE NODE AND NODE SLICES
--IT REFERS TO COLLECTION OF COMPUTING RESOURCES THAT WORK TOGETHER TO STORE & PROCESS DATA
--IT CONSISTS OF ONE OR MORE COMPUTE NODES, EACH EQUIPPED WITH CPU,MEMORY AND STORAGE
--THE DATA IN CLUSTER IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THESE COMPUTE NODES ALLOWING FOR PARALLEL PROCESSING OF QUERIES TO ACHIEVE HIGH PERFORMANCE
 
//LEADER NODE
--CONTROLED AND MANAGED BY AMAZON
--Leader node interacts with client applications and communicates with compute nodes to carry out operations. 
--It parses and generates an execution plan to carry out database operations. 
--Based on execution plan, then it compiles the code. 
  Then compiled code is distributed to all  compute nodes and its data portion to each node.

//COMPUTE NODE-
--ALL YOUR JOB WILL HAPPNED IN DISTRIBUTED MANNER
-- Leader node compile each step of execution plan and assign that to all compute nodes. 
 --  Compute nodes carry out execution of the given compiled code and send back intermediate results back to leader node to
   aggregate the final result for each request from client application.
--Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU, memory and storage which are essentially determined by node type.

//NODE SLICE
--NOTHING BUT PROCESS
--A COMPUTE NODE IS PARTITIONED INTO SLICES.
--Each slice is allocated a portion of nodeâ€™s memory, disk space where it carries out the given workload to the node
-- Leader node manages distributing data to slices for any queries or other database operations to the slices. 
--All slices work in parallel to complete the operation. The number of slices are determined by node size of the cluster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**DENSE STORAGE NODES-LOTS OF STORAGE AND COMPUTE POERT LESS
**DENCE COMPUTE NODES-MORE COMPUTE POWER AND LESS STORAGE POWER
 
**IN SINGLE NODE CLUSTER THERE IS NO LEADER NODE .HERE LEADER AND COMPUTE NODE SHARE THE SAME RESOURCES.
