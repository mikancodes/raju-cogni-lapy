RDS(RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE)
--its a paas service
--it is relational database managed by aws 
--it runs on ec2 instances so you can choose an instance type .
--rds supports some db engines like MySQL,MariaDB,Oracle,Microsoft SQL Server,Amazon Aurora
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY FEATURE OF RDS
--DB instance is a separate environment in the cloud. 
  You can run one or more DB instances and each DB instance supports one or more databases and database schema depends upon engine type
--DB Cluster is a collection of databases maintained by the instance or running DB server for connecting a database.
--Maintenance Window in RDS is periodically to fix all issues of security and reliability in both hardware and software.
  It occurs once per week we may do it in a specific time period or schedule period
--Multi-AZ deployments can have one standby or two standby DB instances. 
  In Multi-AZ the primary instance is created in one zone and the standby instance (secondary instance) is created in another zone. 
  The data in the primary instance is replicated to the standby instance synchronously to avoid failover. Read Replica is the snapshot of the primary DB.


scalability
--ability to add more resources assigned to the cloud services to service increase in demand , such as scaling up and down
--scalinging up means adding more resources to the existing resources.(scaling vertically)
--scaling out means adding new resources parallel to axisting resource.(scalling horizontally) 
--it will happen for a long period of time

autoscaling
--it is the service that we can use to automatically launch and terminate instances on a dynamic basis based on demand.


elasticity
--ability to gain or reduce resources such as cpu processing,ram,network etc on demand without causing system purformance disruption.
--happen for a shorter period of time

load balancing
--process to distribute incoming application traffic accross multiple targets. Such as EC2 instances,containers or ip addresses
--benefits-1.high availability
          -2.fault toralance
          -3.optimal performance
--two types 
  1. network lb(layer 4)
  2.application lb(layer 7)-supports path based routing
  3.classic lb-depricated lb(layes 4 and 7)
                   host based routing
                   source ip based routing
